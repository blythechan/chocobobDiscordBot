# About Chocobob FFXIV Discord Bot
Chocobob is a bot dedicated to assisting you throughout your Final Fantasy journey. It relies heavily on Discord v14.9.0, Node v18.13.0, FFXIVAPI, Lodestone, and FFXIV Collection so if any of these change expect downtime!

# Terms
Chocobob Bot is a fun Discord bot with various commands to not only entertain a Discord user but also assist a FFXIV user along their journey throughout Eorzea and beyond. All actions made by Chocobob require either a command or a command ran by a server moderator. Any data saved is strictly to log the execution of an action and the response created by Chocobob. Message history that is unrelated to a command will not and will never be saved.

# Details
